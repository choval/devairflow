# DevAirflow

Making Airflow pipelines easier to develop locally.

DevAirflow is a command-line tool for Mac & Linux that runs Airflow locally using Docker, streamlining development. It eliminates the need for user management, separate databases, schedulers, and workers.

This setup enables rapid iteration throughout the development process.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This tool is intended for development purposes only.  
> DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

## Installation

Requires:

- Mac üçé or Linux üêß
- Docker üê≥

```sh
curl -o ~/devairflow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choval/devairflow/master/devairflow
chmod +x ~/devairflow
mv ~/devairflow ~/.local/bin/devairflow
```

Move to a bin path like ~/bin or ~/local/bin or ~/.local/bin

## Usage


Go to your project, create a `dags` folder, add your pipelines in it.  
Optionally add a `dags/requirements.txt` for installing extra packages.

```
devairflow start
```

DAGs are reparsed every minute. If you can't wait, run:

```
devairflow parse
```

Create a .env and add your variables and connections.  
After editing them, reload with:

```
devairflow loadenvs
```
